# Summer 2024 QA Hiring Homework

The Repo is a sample React application that will be used to assess the candidate's skills in the QA task. The repo is front-end only.

## The Sample App

The app is a simple Task Manager application that displays a list of Tasks.
A task has 5 ( user-facing ) properties:

```
- Title - string
- Description - string
- Importance - High, Medium, Low
- Label - Work, Social, Home, Hobby
- Completeness - boolean
```

The app has the following features:

1. User should be able to **add** a task
2. User should be able to **delete** a task
3. User should be able to **edit** a task
4. User should be able to **mark** a task as **complete / incomplete**
5. User should be able to **filter** tasks **by label**
6. User should be able to **sort** tasks **by importance**

Product requirements for adding tasks are:

1. Title and Importance are required
2. Description and Label are optional
3. Completeness is set to false by default
4. Importance is set to Medium by default
5. Label is set to Work by default
6. Title should start with capital letter

Other requirements are up to the candidate's interpretation - since a lot of the times on the job, requirements are not clear and the QA has to make a decision based on the context. A thing to keep in mind is that the app should be user-friendly and intuitive.

## Homework

Since the position in itself includes both manual and automated testing - we expect candidates to be proficient in both. The homework is divided into two parts:

1. Manual Testing and Bug Reporting
2. Automated Testing

### Manual Testing and Bug Reporting

- The candidate is expected to test the application and report any bugs found.
- We encourage to look for both functional and visual (UX) bugs.
- The candidate should provide a report of the bugs found. You will be evaluated on the quality of the report and the bugs found.\n

### Automated Testing

The candidate is expected to write automated tests for the application, by choosing either Cypress or Playwright as the testing framework.
Here is what should be covered

- 5 user stories
- 3 regression tests for functional bugs found during manual testing ( they should fail when run, because the bugs are not fixed yet )
- A test that generates a test of all possible combinations of the task properties ( importance, label, completeness ) and takes a screenshot of the app after each combination is added.

## Steps to follow

1. Fork this public repo into a private repo
2. Invite the reviewer to the forked repo
3. Clone the forked repo
4. cd into the app folder and Install the dependencies `npm install`
5. Run the app using `npm run dev`
6. Start testing the app
7. Write the bug report based on findings and commit it in the root folder ( not the app folder)
8. Install the testing framework of your choice
9. Write the automated tests
10. Commit the tests to the app folder
11. Push the changes to the forked repo on a new branch
12. Open a PR to the main branch
13. Add the reviewer as a reviewer to the PR

If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue in your private repo ( so other candidates don't see the questions ) and I'll do my best to answer them ASAP.
